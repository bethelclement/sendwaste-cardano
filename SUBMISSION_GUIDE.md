## Main Problem Statement

**What is the main problem your project intends to solve?**

In Nigeria, 70% of 32 million tons of annual household waste remains uncollected due to broken trust between residents and waste collectors. Traditional systems lack transparency, with no proof of service delivery or environmental impact tracking. This leads to:
- Uncollected waste accumulating in neighborhoods
- Zero accountability for waste management services
- No incentives for residents to participate in proper waste disposal
- Inability to track or verify environmental impact

SendWaste solves this by creating blockchain-verified proof of waste collection, making the process transparent, accountable, and rewarding.

## Cardano Integration

**How is Cardano integrated in your solution?**

SendWaste uses Cardano blockchain as the core trust infrastructure:

1. **Aiken Smart Contracts**: Formal verification for GPS-validated waste submissions
   - Contract validates location data to prevent fraud
   - Ensures waste is actually collected from submitted coordinates
   - Immutable record of all transactions

2. **On-Chain Rewards**: Instant token distribution for verified waste collection
   - 15¢ transaction costs (vs $5-50 on Ethereum)
   - 1,000 TPS capability for scaling to 100,000+ users
   - Users earn tokens immediately upon verification

3. **NFT Receipts (CIP-25)**: Blockchain-verified proof of collection
   - Each waste submission minted as compliant NFT
   - Permanent, tamper-proof record of environmental impact
   - Exportable for ESG reporting

4. **Transparent Dashboard**: Real-time on-chain impact tracking
   - Total waste recycled
   - CO₂ emissions avoided
   - Water conserved
   - All verified by Cardano blockchain

**Why Cardano?**
- Cost-effective (15¢ vs $5-50)
- Scalable (1,000 TPS)
- Formal verification (Aiken)
- Energy-efficient (99% less than proof-of-work)
