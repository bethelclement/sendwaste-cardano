## 🎤 HACKATHON PITCH (60-Second Version)

*"I'm Bethel Clement, founder of SendWaste. We're solving Africa's $2.3 trillion waste crisis with blockchain verification.*

*Nigeria produces 32 million tons of waste yearly. 70% never gets collected. Zero trust in the system.*

*SendWaste changes this: Submit waste with a photo. Aiken smart contracts verify it on-chain in 30 seconds. Users instantly earn $WASTE tokens. NFT receipts prove environmental impact.*

*We're live on Cardano testnet today. Real Aiken contracts. Real users. Real transactions.*

*Four revenue streams: platform fees, corporate ESG, government contracts, marketplace. $2.5M ARR by year 3.*

*We're raising $250K to scale our Abuja pilot to 10,000 users and sign our first government contract.*

*The demo is live: sendwaste-cardano.vercel.app*

*Join us in making environmental accountability the default in Africa."*
