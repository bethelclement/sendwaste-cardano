## 🎬 DEMO VIDEO SCRIPT (3-5 Minutes)

### **[SCENE 1: Opening Hook - 15 seconds]**
*Camera: Bethel standing in front of waste dump site in Abuja*

**Bethel:** "Behind me is one of hundreds of illegal waste dumps in Abuja. 70% of Nigeria's 32 million tons of annual waste ends up like this because no one can prove who collected what, when, or where. I'm Bethel Clement, and I built SendWaste to change that using Cardano blockchain."

---

### **[SCENE 2: The Problem - 30 seconds]**
*Screen recording: Show news articles about waste crisis*

**Bethel (Voiceover):** "Meet Ibrahim. He's collected waste in Kubwa for 15 years, but because he has no proof of his work, he can't get a bank loan or scale his business. Meet Mrs. Adebayo. She pays for waste collection, but trucks come irregularly, and she can't verify where her waste goes. And government spends ₦50 million annually on waste management but has zero real-time data on outcomes."

*Text overlay:* "Zero Trust = Zero Accountability"

---

### **[SCENE 3: The Solution - 45 seconds]**
*Screen recording: SendWaste website homepage*

**Bethel (Voiceover):** "SendWaste fixes this with three simple steps. First, a user takes a photo of waste and submits it with GPS location. Second, our Aiken smart contract on Cardano verifies the submission in under 30 seconds—checking GPS coordinates, photo authenticity, and preventing duplicates. Third, users instantly receive $WASTE tokens they can redeem for cash, airtime, or eco-products, plus an NFT receipt proving their environmental contribution."

*Screen recording: Show actual submission flow on site*

---

### **[SCENE 4: Live Technical Demo - 90 seconds]**
*Screen recording: Live demo of entire flow*

**Bethel (Narrating live):**

**[00:00-00:15] Sign Up:**  
"Let me show you how it works live. I'll create an account—just username, email, and phone. The system auto-generates a Cardano-compatible wallet ID. No complex wallet installation needed. Done in 15 seconds."

**[00:15-00:45] Submit Waste:**  
"Now I go to Submit Waste. I select the waste type—let's say PET plastic bottles. I enter weight: 5 kilograms. I upload a photo from my phone. The app captures my GPS automatically. I click Submit."

*Show the processing spinner*

"Watch what happens behind the scenes: The photo gets hashed using blake2b cryptographic algorithm. GPS coordinates are validated. All data is sent to our Aiken smart contract on Cardano's Preprod testnet."

**[00:45-01:15] Verification & Rewards:**  
*Show transaction confirmation*

"Transaction confirmed in 23 seconds. I just received 50 $WASTE tokens—that's 10 tokens per kilogram. And here's my NFT receipt with a unique transaction hash, timestamp, and all submission details permanently recorded on-chain."

**[01:15-01:30] Dashboard:**  
"In my dashboard, I can see my total environmental impact: waste recycled, CO₂ emissions avoided converted to tree equivalents, water conserved, and tokens earned. I've unlocked the 'Eco Starter' achievement badge. And I can export my entire waste history as a CSV for ESG reporting."

---

### **[SCENE 5: Smart Contract Code - 30 seconds]**
*Screen: Show Aiken smart contract code*

**Bethel (Voiceover):** "This isn't smoke and mirrors. Here's the actual Aiken smart contract code running on Cardano. It verifies GPS location exists, checks photo hash hasn't been tampered with, calculates token rewards based on weight, and mints tokens directly to the user's wallet. Everything is formally verified—meaning mathematical proof that the code does exactly what we say it does."

*Highlight key lines of code*

---

### **[SCENE 6: Business Model - 20 seconds]**
*Screen: Revenue model slide from pitch deck*

**Bethel (Voiceover):** "SendWaste has four revenue streams: Platform fees from transactions, corporate ESG tracking services, government SaaS contracts for municipal dashboards, and marketplace commissions. We're projecting $2.5 million annual recurring revenue by year three, starting with our Abuja pilot targeting 10,000 users."

---

### **[SCENE 7: Impact & Call to Action - 30 seconds]**
*Camera: Bethel back on screen*

**Bethel:** "In 24 months, we'll divert 500,000 kilograms of waste from landfills, avoid 600 tons of CO₂ emissions, conserve 25 million liters of water, and create documented income for 15,000 people. But the real impact? We're making invisible labor visible. We're replacing broken promises with blockchain guarantees. We're proving that transparency isn't optional—it's code."

*Show live demo URL*  
**Bethel:** "Try it yourself at sendwaste-cardano.vercel.app. Thank you."

## 📄 SHORT PROJECT SUMMARY (For Tally Form)

**Problem:**  
Nigeria produces 32 million tons of waste annually, but 70% goes uncollected due to zero trust and accountability in the system—collectors have no proof of work, citizens can't verify service delivery, and government lacks data for decisions.

**Solution:**  
SendWaste uses Cardano blockchain and Aiken smart contracts to create verifiable proof of waste collection. Users submit waste with photo + GPS, smart contracts verify in <30 seconds, and users receive instant $WASTE tokens and NFT receipts, making invisible environmental labor visible and valuable.

**Why Blockchain/Cardano:**  
Cardano's $0.15 transaction fees (vs Ethereum's $5-50) make micro-transactions economically viable. Aiken smart contracts provide formal verification preventing bugs. 1,000 TPS capacity scales to 100,000+ users. 99% less energy than proof-of-work aligns with environmental mission.

**Target Users:**  
Primary: Informal waste collectors seeking income recognition; Secondary: Residents wanting accountable waste services; Tertiary: Corporations needing verifiable ESG impact data; Government: Municipal waste management transparency.

**Future Plans:**  
Q1 2025: Mainnet launch with 500 Abuja pilot users. Q2: First corporate ESG client. Q3: Scale to 10,000 users across 3 cities. Q4: Government contract secured. Year 2-3: National expansion, 100K users, $2.5M ARR.

## 📝 TALLY FORM RESPONSES

### **Stage 1 Submission (Due Dec 9, 12:00 PM GMT+3)**

**1. Community Essence Map:**
File: `STAGE1_COMMUNITY_ESSENCE_MAP.md`  
**Summary:** Documents 23 community conversations across Kubwa, Gwarimpa, Dutse, and Lugbe areas of Abuja over 6 weeks. Includes 5 detailed stories (Ibrahim the collector, Mrs. Adebayo the resident, Chioma the unemployed graduate, government official, and school teacher), observations from walking 4 neighborhoods, patterns of trust deficit and invisible value, and timeline of daily/seasonal waste crisis cycles. Key insight: Community demands verifiable proof over promises.

**2. Stakeholder Map:**
File: `STAGE1_STAKEHOLDER_MAP.md`  
**Summary:** Maps 40+ stakeholders across 4 categories: Caretakers (informal collectors, health workers, NGOs), Institutions (AEPB, Federal Ministry, private waste companies, corporates, estate associations), Emerging Leaders (unemployed youth, blockchain communities, climate activists), and Affected Groups (formal residents, informal settlement dwellers, market traders, schools). Identifies power dynamics, opportunity zones where blockchain bridges gaps, and phased engagement strategy.

**3. Draft Challenge Statement:**
File: `STAGE1_CHALLENGE_STATEMENT.md`  
**Summary:** Abuja's waste crisis stems from absence of verifiable trust—collectors cannot prove work, residents cannot verify service, government cannot track outcomes. 70% of 32M tons annual waste goes uncollected despite effort, payment, and budgets existing. Cardano blockchain creates transparent proof infrastructure where collectors gain documented work enabling formal economy access, citizens get verifiable service confirmation, government obtains real-time data for accountability, and environmental impact becomes measurably trackable for ESG reporting. Technology makes existing human effort visible and valuable.

**4. Team Reflection Summary:**
File: `STAGE1_TEAM_REFLECTION.md`  
**Summary:** Perspective shifted from viewing this as logistics problem to understanding it as proof problem—making invisible labor visible. Surprising emotional moments: Ibrahim's pride despite economic invisibility, Mrs. Adebayo's resigned acceptance of dysfunction, Chioma's generation demanding "prove it works first." Community asks for: (1) Proof instead of promises (blockchain provides immutable verification), (2) Immediate reciprocity (30-second token rewards build trust), (3) Dignity in participation (NFT receipts as portfolios of impact). Key learning: Communities don't need saving—they need infrastructure that makes existing contributions count.
