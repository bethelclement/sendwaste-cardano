## What Shifted in Our Perspective?

When I started this project, I thought the problem was simple: "Waste isn't being collected properly." I imagined building an app that would make collection more efficient—route optimization, scheduling, digital payments. A typical tech-first solution to what I perceived as a logistics problem.

But walking through Kubwa Market that first morning in mid-October changed everything. I watched Ibrahim, a waste collector, spend three hours sorting through recyclables under the hot sun. When I asked how much he'd earn that day, he said "maybe ₦500" (about $0.60 USD). Then he said something that stopped me: *"The problem isn't the work. I know how to collect waste. The problem is nobody believes I did it."*

**That shifted my entire framing.** This isn't a logistics problem. It's a **proof problem**. It's about making invisible labor visible. Making informal work formal. Creating trust where none exists.

The deeper I went—speaking to residents in Gwarimpa who'd lost faith in government services, talking to the environmental board official who confessed they manage millions of naira blindly, listening to Chioma describe unemployment despite her economics degree—the clearer it became: **everyone in this system is acting rationally given the zero-trust environment they're operating in.**

Residents don't separate recyclables because they don't trust collectors will actually recycle them. Collectors can't invest in better equipment because they can't prove their work to get bank loans. Government can't hold contractors accountable because there's no verifiable data. Contractors sometimes fail to deliver because payment is delayed and inconsistent.

**The technical solution I was imagining (an efficient collection app) would have failed because it wouldn't address the root problem: absence of verifiable truth.**

That realization redirected the entire project toward blockchain—not because blockchain is trendy, but because trustless verification is precisely what the community needs and is asking for, even if they don't use those exact words.

## What Surprised or Moved Us?

**Three moments stand out emotionally:**

**1. Ibrahim's pride despite invisibility:**  
When Ibrahim showed me photos on his phone of the areas he'd cleaned, his face lit up with genuine pride. He'd been doing this work for 15 years. He knew exactly which households separated their recyclables. He could identify every type of plastic by touch. **He was a skilled professional, not a desperate scavenger.** But the formal economy had no category for him. No recognition. No pathway upward.

That moved me because I realized we weren't just building a waste app—we were building an economic inclusion tool. Every verified transaction would be a tiny act of recognition. *"Yes, you did this work. Here is proof. You are seen."*

**2. Mrs. Adebayo's quiet resignation:**  
In Gwarimpa, Mrs. Adebayo told me about her children getting sick from waste fumes. But what struck me wasn't her anger—it was her *acceptance*. She said, "This is just how things are here." That passive acceptance of dysfunction felt almost more painful than active protest.

It made me understand: people aren't expecting miracles. They've been disappointed so many times that radical transparency feels almost fantastical to them. **The bar is absurdly low**. We don't need to build something perfect. We just need to build something that keeps its promises, consistently, every single time.

**3. Chioma's generation waiting for something to believe in:**  
When I spoke to Chioma and her group of young unemployed graduates, the energy was electric. They didn't need convincing about blockchain or technology. What they needed was **a believable opportunity**. They've grown up watching corruption, broken promises, and opportunities that evaporate. But they haven't become cynical—they've become careful.

Chioma said: *"Show me it works. Don't tell me. Show me someone who earned tokens today and withdrew cash today. Then I'll join."* That demand for proof before participation made me realize our MVP demo had to be REAL. Not a prototype. Not "coming soon." Actually functional from day one.

Their pragmatic hope—not naive optimism, but *"prove it and we're in"*—became the design constraint for everything we built.

## What Does the Community Appear to Be Asking For?

Synthesizing 23 conversations, the community is asking for three things:

### 1. **Proof Instead of Promises**
Not another government program that gets announced and evaporates.  
Not another NGO initiative that depends on foreign funding cycles.  
Not another contractor who says "we'll come next week."

**They want systems that carry their own proof of functioning.**

Blockchain became obvious not because it's innovative, but because it's the only infrastructure that makes promises verifiable by default. The community isn't saying "we want blockchain"—they're saying "we want proof," and blockchain happens to be the technology that provides immutable proof.

### 2. **Immediate Reciprocity**
"Do good, get rewarded" must happen IMMEDIATELY. Not weekly. Not monthly. Not "we'll review your case."

This came up again and again. People have been exploited by delayed payment systems. They've submitted work and been told "come back next month." They've participated in cleanups with promises of compensation that never materialized.

**Instant token rewards aren't a feature—they're a prerequisite for trust.**

The 30-second verification time we optimized for isn't about technical showmanship. It's about emotional reassurance. If I submit waste at 2pm, I want to see those tokens in my wallet at 2:01pm. Every second of delay is a chance for doubt to creep in.

### 3. **Dignity in Participation**
This was subtle but crucial. People don't want charity. They want economic participation with dignity.

Ibrahim doesn't want a handout. He wants his work to be recognized as valuable professional labor. Youth don't want UBI. They want jobs that build skills and provide upward mobility.

**NFT receipts serve this purpose.** Yes, functionally they're just blockchain records. But symbolically, they're proof of environmental contribution. They're something to show. Something to be proud of. A portfolio of impact.

When I asked collectors what they'd want to see on an NFT, they didn't say "make it fancy." They said: "Make it show what I actually did. The weight of waste. The type. The location. Make it REAL."

**The community is asking for technology that makes their existing contributions visible and valuable—not technology that replaces them with automation.**

## Closing Thought

The most profound learning from this exploration: **communities don't need saving by outsiders with solutions. They need infrastructure that makes their existing efforts count.**

Waste collection is already happening. Environmental care already exists. Economic activity is already occurring. But it's all happening in a zero-trust shadow economy where nothing can be proven, nothing can be built upon, and no one can scale.

Blockchain doesn't create the solution. The community is the solution. **Blockchain just makes their solution visible, verifiable, and valuable.**

That reframe—from "we're solving waste collection" to "we're making existing waste collection provable"—is what made SendWaste grounded in reality rather than Silicon Valley saviorism.
