        <h1>Project Details</h1>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>Nigeria produces 32 million tons of waste annually, with 70 percent going uncollected. The system fails not from
        lack of effort but from absence of verifiable trust. Informal waste collectors cannot prove their work to access
        banking or credit. Citizens pay for services but cannot verify if waste was properly handled. Government budgets
        millions for waste management but has no real-time data on contractor performance or environmental outcomes.
        This trust vacuum perpetuates poverty for workers, unsanitary conditions for residents, and unmet climate
        commitments for the nation.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>SendWaste creates blockchain-verified proof of waste collection using Cardano smart contracts. Users photograph
        waste and submit it with GPS location. Aiken smart contracts verify submissions in under 30 seconds by
        validating coordinates, hashing photos to prevent tampering, and checking for duplicates. Users instantly
        receive WASTE tokens (redeemable for cash, airtime, or products) and NFT receipts proving their environmental
        contribution. Everything records permanently on Cardano blockchain, creating transparent accountability where
        none existed.</p>

    <h2>Why Blockchain and Cardano</h2>
    <p>Blockchain solves trust problems by making promises verifiable by default. Cardano specifically enables this at
        scale in emerging markets: transaction fees average 15 cents versus 5-50 dollars on Ethereum, making
        micro-transactions economically viable when users earn perhaps 50 cents per submission. The network handles
        1,000 transactions per second, scaling to our target of 100,000 monthly users. Aiken smart contracts provide
        formal verification, meaning mathematical proof the code does exactly what we claim with no hidden bugs. Cardano
        uses 99 percent less energy than proof-of-work chains, aligning with our environmental mission. Finally, Cardano
        already has government partnerships in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania, providing existing infrastructure and
        relationships in Africa.</p>

    <h2>Target Users</h2>
    <p>Primary users are informal waste collectors seeking documented proof of work that enables access to formal
        banking and credit. Secondary users include residents wanting accountability for waste services they pay for,
        with rewards for participation. Corporate users need verifiable ESG impact data for sustainability reporting
        through our white-label tracking solution. Government municipalities require real-time dashboards showing where
        waste is collected, who performs the work, and what environmental impact results, enabling data-driven decisions
        instead of blind budget allocation.</p>

    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
    <p>Q1 2025: Deploy smart contracts to Cardano mainnet and launch Abuja pilot with 500 beta users recruited from
        informal collector networks. Q2 2025: Sign first corporate ESG client for white-label waste tracking, validating
        B2B revenue model. Q3 2025: Scale to 10,000 active users across Abuja, Lagos, and Port Harcourt through
        partnerships with waste collector cooperatives. Q4 2025: Secure first municipal government contract, proving
        government adoption pathway. Year 2: Expand nationally to 40,000 users, sign 5 corporate clients, establish 3
        government partnerships. Year 3: Reach 100,000 active users processing 500,000 kilograms monthly, generating 2.5
        million dollars in annual recurring revenue across four revenue streams: platform transaction fees, corporate
        ESG contracts, government SaaS subscriptions, and marketplace commissions.</p>
