## The Challenge

In Abuja, 70% of the 32 million tons of annual waste goes uncollected, creating health hazards and environmental degradation that directly impacts vulnerable communities. The root cause is not lack of effort—informal collectors work tirelessly, citizens want clean neighborhoods, and government budgets exist—but rather a complete **absence of verifiable trust and accountability** in the system. Collectors cannot prove their work to access the formal economy, residents cannot verify if their payments result in actual service delivery, and government cannot track where taxpayer money goes or measure environmental outcomes. This trust vacuum perpetuates a cycle where everyone loses: workers remain invisible and poor despite contributing labor, citizens live in unsanitary conditions despite paying for services, and the environment degrades while climate commitments go unmet.

**Blockchain technology, specifically Cardano's Aiken smart contracts, offers a meaningful opportunity to rebuild this broken trust infrastructure by creating transparent, tamper-proof proof of waste collection that benefits all stakeholders simultaneously.** When a waste submission is verified on-chain, collectors gain documented proof of work that opens doors to formal banking and credit, citizens receive verifiable confirmation of service delivery linked to their payment, government obtains real-time data for policy decisions and contractor accountability, and environmental impact becomes measurably trackable for corporate ESG reporting and international climate commitments. Technology does not replace human systems—rather, it makes the existing human effort visible, valuable, and verifiable for the first time.
