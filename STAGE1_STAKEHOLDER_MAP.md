## Key Insights from Stakeholder Analysis

### Power Dynamics
1. **Government has regulatory power** but lacks data and accountability
2. **Informal collectors have operational power** but no recognition
3. **Citizens have payment power** but no leverage
4. **Corporates have money** but need impact verification

### Opportunity Zones
1. **Government-Collector Gap:** Neither can prove the other's performance → Blockchain bridges this
2. **Citizen-Service Gap:** Payment without accountability → Smart contracts enforce fairness
3. **Corporate-Impact Gap:** Spend on CSR without proof → NFT receipts provide verification

### Resistance Points
1. **Incumbent contractors** may resist transparency (threatens corruption)
2. **Digital literacy barriers** for older collectors (mitigated by simple UX)
3. **Regulatory uncertainty** around blockchain/tokens (addressed through utility token model)
