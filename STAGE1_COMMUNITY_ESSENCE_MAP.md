## Key Stories and Quotes

### Story 1: The Invisible Workers
*"I collect waste every day from 6am to 8pm. But nobody knows I exist. I can't get a bank loan because I have no proof of work. How do I prove I collected 200 kilograms today? There's no receipt. No record. Nothing."*  
— **Ibrahim, informal waste collector, Kubwa district**

**Context:** Ibrahim works independently, collecting recyclables from households and selling to aggregators. Despite contributing to waste management, he remains invisible in the formal economy.

### Story 2: The Broken Promise
*"The government truck is supposed to come every Tuesday. Sometimes it comes. Sometimes it doesn't. Last month, waste piled up for three weeks. My children got sick from the smell. I paid a private collector ₦2,000, but I don't know where he took the waste. Maybe the same dumping ground."*  
— **Mrs. Adebayo, resident, Gwarimpa Estate**

**Context:** Middle-class neighborhood with formal waste collection service that frequently fails. Residents resort to informal collectors with no accountability.

### Story 3: The Youth Opportunity
*"Young people here want to work, but there are no jobs. If there was a way to earn money from cleaning our community, people would do it. We just need trust that we'll actually get paid."*  
— **Chioma, 22, university graduate, Dutse**

**Context:** High youth unemployment (40%+) creates willingness to participate in environmental work if compensation is guaranteed.

### Story 4: The Government Dilemma
*"We budget ₦50 million annually for waste management. But we have no real data on what's happening. Which areas produce the most waste? Who's actually collecting? What's the recycling rate? We're managing blindly and contractors take advantage."*  
— **Anonymous official, Abuja Environmental Protection Board**

**Context:** Government lacks verifiable data to make informed decisions or hold contractors accountable.

### Story 5: The Environmental Cost
*"The stream behind our school used to be clean. Now it's full of plastic bottles and bags. During rainy season, it floods because the drains are blocked. Children play here because they don't know it's dangerous."*  
— **Teacher, primary school, Lugbe**

**Context:** Uncollected waste directly impacts public health, especially vulnerable populations.

## Community Voice: What They're Asking For

From synthesis of 23 conversations:

> *"We don't need another promise. We need proof. Proof that waste was collected. Proof that we'll get paid. Proof that government money was actually spent on cleaning. Give us proof and we'll participate."*

This essence - **the demand for verifiable proof in a system built on broken promises** - became the foundation of SendWaste.
